    "Matlab is very popular in the  engineering/science/academic world (I used all Matlab for my PhD thesis in Oceanography). However, it is also expensive and not open-source, so as a data scientist you probably will want to be able to work with the data in Python. In this notebook, i'll show how to import Matlab data files (.mat) into python. I learned this from the 'Importing Data Into Python' course on Datacamp (<https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-1>), taught by Hugo Bowne-Anderson."
